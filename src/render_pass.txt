A render pass is defines 1 or more subpasses, all of which will run the graphics pipeline. 
There exist three types of Attachments: color buffers, depth buffers or stencil buffers
- color buffers store the final color value (RGBA) that will be displayed on the screen (usually the device format)
- depth buffers track the distance from the camera in 3D to ensure the correct rendering of overlapping objects
- stencil buffers enables more complex operations to decide what pixels to draw or discard

- loadOp LOAD_OP_CLEAR means that the image is completely wiped at the start of the render pass (so, for each frame)
- storeOp STORE_OP_STORE means that the contents are stored in memory for further use (like presentation)

- initialLayout UNDEFINED -> attachment previous contents are discarded
- finalLayout PRESENT_SRC_KHR -> present the final image

VkAttachmentReference describes how a subpass will use the attachment
