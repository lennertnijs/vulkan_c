To work with visual studio, make sure to install cglm, vulkan SDK and glfw somewhere. In project->properties, make sure under the C/C++ directory to include the \include directories for each of the three under "additional include directories". Finally, do not forget to include the D:\glfw\glfw-3.4.bin.WIN64\lib-vc2022 and D:\Vulkan\Lib under linker -> general -> additional library directories
